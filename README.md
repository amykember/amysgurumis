# Amy's Gurumis

This is my Zola blog. Hoo-rah.

## What it uses

The repository is on GitHub: https://github.com/amykember/amysgurumis.

We use the Zola static site generator: https://www.getzola.org.

The website is hosted for free on Netlify: https://app.netlify.com/sites/amysgurumis.

We pay NameSilo for the domain name: https://www.namesilo.com/account_domains.php.

## How to do stuff

### Preview the website

In VS Code, press Cmd+Shift+B.

Or, go to _Explorer_ (Cmd+Shift+E), find _Task Runner_ at the bottom, and click "Open Website".

Or, open a terminal (Ctrl+Backtick), run `zola serve`, and visit http://127.0.0.1:1111.

### Publish changes

1. If you have a draft that's ready to be published, remove the `draft = true` line.

2. If you're publishing a new post, time might have passed since you created it. Rename the file so that it starts with the current date.

3. Go to _Explorer_ (Cmd+Shift+E), find _Task Runner_ at the bottom, and click "Fix Stuff". This will automatically add or fix the `path = "..."` lines below the titles of each page/post.

4. Commit your changes (Cmd+Shift+P, start typing "Git: Commit All").

5. Push to GitHub (Cmd+Shift+P, start typing "Git: Push").

### Add a blog post

Go to _Explorer_ (Cmd+Shift+E), find _Task Runner_ at the bottom, and click "New Blog Post".

To change the slug, rename the file (keeping the date in front) and then run "Fix Stuff" (see "Publish changes" step 3).

### Add a page

Go to _Explorer_ (Cmd+Shift+E), find _Task Runner_ at the bottom, and click "New Page".

To change the slug, rename the file (keeping the number in front) and then run "Fix Stuff" (see "Publish changes" step 3).

To reorder pages, change the numbers at the front of their filenames and run "Fix Stuff".

### Remove a post/page

You can delete the file, or just add `draft = true` under `title = "..."` so that it won't be published.
