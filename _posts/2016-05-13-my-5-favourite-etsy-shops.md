If you can't tell, I'm a one-trick pony üê¥ when it comes to crafts; amigurumi and amigurumi. So it's no suprise that my favourite Etsy shops sell amigurumi patterns. But there's still variety to be had. Recently I've been dappling in knitted toys and different crochet techniques with the help of patterns from the shops below. These are my highest recommendations for the adventurous amigurumi-er!

# 1.¬†[LuvlyGurumi][lg]

This shop has been a favourite of mine for years. I've purchased nearly every LuvlyGurumi pattern. The placement of the safety eyes and mouth designs are so sweet. The patterns are clear, well written, and include photos. My favourite is the [monkey][] with his adorable hood and banana.¬†I'm a huge fan of using the same yarn for all of my patterns. I use Bernat Handicrafter Cotton for mine; this shop uses Vanna's Choice, which has a great range of colours for amigurumi.

# 2.¬†[Mary Jane's Tea Room][mjtr]

This shop is unbelievably cute, especially the [Little Yarn Dolls][lyd] pattern. I purchased Method 2, which is knit flat and then seamed because I'm not comfortable using circular needles just yet. I love that this shop offers both a flat and circular version of the same pattern.

# 3.¬†[Dolly Time][dt]

Another knitted toy shop, and the dolls are so sweet! A couple of years ago I knitted a puppet from this shop:¬†[Ruby and Rose Hand Puppets][rrhp]. The pattern was easy to follow even though I'm not an experienced knitter, and turned out just like the photos.

# 4.¬†[Bubbles and Bongo][bb]

This is a shop I only recently discovered and fell in love with the photography. I've purchased¬†[Pippa the Pig][pp], and I'll post a picture once I've crocheted her.

# 5.¬†[Hookabee][hb]

I'm always excited to discover fellow Canadian amigurumi designers! I've attempted crocheting in the back loops only, but never designed a toy I'm happy with following this method. Hookabee has inspired me to give it another go!¬†I've purchased the [Narwhal][] pattern.
