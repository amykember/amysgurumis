My obsession with Call the Midwife has entered the ultimate phase: the amigurumifiying of one of my favourite characters‚Ä¶Chummy! She‚Äôs just tickety-boo and marvelous, weighs about the size of a turkey ü¶É, and I refer to her as ‚Äúlittle bean‚Äù.

I started crocheting her over a month ago. Plenty of trial and error, sweaty aluminum crochet hooks in humid weather, too many trips to Michaels, a request for my cousins to loan me a spiffing pair of American Girl doll glasses, and combing through Call the Midwife photos to make sure I chose yarn as close to the real-life colours as possible have all culminated in my Camilla Fortescue-Cholmeley-Browne amigurumi. It was a bit of a scrape, but she‚Äôs finished, and I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased.

Listening to the Call the Midwife soundtrack and re-watching episodes from the first two series passed the time while I crocheted. I had to redo the blue uniform three times to make it fit just right. Maybe I should have used crimplene instead of Snuggly Wuggly acrylic? And of course, I will have to make another in eau-de-nil; I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd look a picture in that!

I‚Äôve included photos of my notes, which will hopefully be written up into a proper pattern someday.

Even once I‚Äôd completed her, it couldn‚Äôt be as simple as taking pictures and posting them. The photo that turned out best was one where I‚Äôd forgotten to include the delivery bag. I called upon the generous services of my brother. He photoshopped the delivery bag into the photo for me and did a fantastic job. Bravo Mitch! Except we both came to the conclusion that the original picture looked better, even without the bag. Still, I had to give him credit for wasting his evening.

Hope all of you Call the Midwife fans enjoy these pictures of Chummy while you wait eagerly for series three! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd all agree that she‚Äôs the sort of amigurumi a chap‚Äôs mother would like.
