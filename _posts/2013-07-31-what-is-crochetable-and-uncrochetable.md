I can tell you what is uncrochetable...a wimple. Ok, it was a little more difficult to think of a Sister Bernadette quote for the title than it was to rework Chummy witticisms into last week's post, but it's the best I could come up with.

Sister Bernadette is my favourite character from Call the Midwife. Before I bore you with details about the design process, I want to thank everyone for the comments I received on the Chummy doll. I'm just waiting to find out whether Neal Street producers will let me share the pattern ðŸ¤ž.

I assumed that since the basic pattern was already designed, Sister Bernadette would be a cinch. Wrong. Like I mentioned, the wimple was a challenge. I had to revert to white felt. And there was the glasses. Not even American Girl Doll and certainly not Michaels carry 50's style glasses complete with an upsweep. These specs were crafted out of lenses I popped from a plastic pair of doll glasses, a paper clip, and two paper fasteners. All assembled by my brother with pliers and a glue gun.

I also had issues with sizing. The doll was turning out too tall and too wide compared with Chummy. I thought I should start from scratch and use different yarn in a lighter weight. But when I finished crocheting a head out of Paton's Grace, it turned out about the size of my thumbnail...a little smaller than I was going for. After that setback, I returned to the original that I had been so frustrated with. Once finished, I ended up happy with how she turned out. She is a little bigger than I had planned, but so cute that I don't think it matters.

Stay tuned for my next addition, which may have something to do with post-sanatorium Sister Bernadette ðŸ˜‰.
