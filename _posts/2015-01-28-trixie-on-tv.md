My newest addition to the CTM amigurumis is Nurse Franklin. The One Show revealed this Trixie doll to surprise Helen George in [tonight's episode](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007tcw7). Watching the dolls being mentioned on TV ðŸ“º was surreal, like dancing to the sound of the river and Ella Fitzgerald; definitely a pivotal moment.

To make the dolls more varied, I crocheted a clinic outfit as well as the typical midwife get up. The fun part was designing the eyelashes and makeup ðŸ’„, which I've never really attempted on an amigurumi before. I love the challenge of matching the dolls as closely as possible to their character. Of course, this particular crocheted midwife operates strictly on telepathy!
