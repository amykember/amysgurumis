Check out the [first episode of the Amy's Gurumis podcast][podcast]! It's easier to show than tell, so this is how I plan to share my projects going forward. Subscribe to my YouTube channel for future episodes.

# Finished Objects: Whovian Graphgan
I've completed my Whovian Graphgan following the pattern on the [Two Hearts Crochet blog][thcb]. This is a long-time project that I started at Christmas a year and a half ago. I've crocheted squares for the Doctor Who logo, the TARDIS, and the 10th and 11th doctors using Vanna's Choice for the backgrounds and Bernat Handicrafter Cotton for the images. I joined the squares following this [tutorial by The Crafty Mummy][tcm]; it creates a strong bind with a really clean finish. Such a warm and heavy blanket will get lots of use this winter ‚òÉÔ∏è!

# Works in Progress: Naomi the knitted doll
Here is my version of "Naomi" from the [My Knitted Doll book][mkd] by Louise Crowther. I'm using Paton's Grace sport weight and the bright colours work well. The instructions include photos of knitting techniques and sewing-up steps. As an inexperieneced knitter, they are very much appreciated.

# Pattern Design: Flat doll
Introducing Flat Doll! I'm so excited to be writing patterns again. This doll was born from my dislike for assembling amigurumi. She's crocheted in one piece, so there's very little sewing up to do at the end. She's still 3D, but a flatter shape than most amigurumi. The increases are placed on either side of the doll instead of being evenly dispersed. This gives her a rag-doll feel that's perfect for play and travel and saves on time, yarn, and stuffing. I'm crocheting a few more dolls to test out the pattern and to capture the photos that will accompany the written instructions.

# Acquisitions: Harry Potter-inspired gift
Special thanks to Karyn and Katie from [BlueBirdYarn][bby] for the beautiful 50g Harry Potter skeins they sent me. This includes Wingardium Leviosa, Herminone J. Grainger, Brightest Witch of Her Age, and Luna's Spectrespecs. I am hoping to cast on [Hermione's Every Day socks][heds] üß¶, which seems like the perfect pattern for these colourways.

They also included stitch markers that I'm making use of as I crochet flat dolls. I usually use bobby pins to keep my place in a project, but I'm enjoying these little guys; they're so sweet üòä.
