I'm back today with some amigurumiÂ inspiration. Kathleen is a talented crocheter; she made the amigurumi below by following theÂ [Little Bunny][bunny] pattern. Kathleen contacted me on Etsy andÂ made a great request for the [Little Bunny's wardrobe][wardrobe]: open backed shirts and dresses so the clothing is easier to take on and off and you don't have to stretch shirts over the bunny's head.

I wrote up a [pattern for an open backed shirt][shirt], and Kathleen cleverly adapted the instructions to several outfits that you can see below. Her designs are so creative!

{% include image.html src="/assets/img_1301.jpg" desc="Shirt" %}

{% include image.html src="/assets/img_1304.jpg" desc="Nightgown and cap" %}

{% include image.html src="/assets/img_1300.jpg" desc="Shirt and bow" %}

{% include image.html src="/assets/bunny_11.jpg" desc="Tutu" %}

I'm looking forward to trying this out with different bunny outfits myself. It's great when crocheters findÂ improvements the designer hasn't thought of. Thank you Kathleen ðŸ˜€!
