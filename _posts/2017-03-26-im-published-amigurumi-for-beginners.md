I've got an exciting announcement to share...ten of my patterns have been published in a bookazine by Future Publishing 👏. They tech-edited the patterns and photographed the toys! All I had to do was convert the patterns to UK crochet terms. The Production Editor Jen Neal was wonderful to work with, and she sent me these screenshots of my designs in print.

Update: You can now purchase the 2nd edition of the [bookazine (Amigurumi for Beginners)][bookazine].
