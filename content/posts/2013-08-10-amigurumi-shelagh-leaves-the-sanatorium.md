Sister Bernadette is no longer Sister Bernadette, on the show or in my crocheted versions of Call the Midwife! I didn't end up crocheting at all on our trip to New York City 🏙️, but we arrived home last night and I finished her this morning. All I had to do was crochet another outfit and removable hair for the original doll that used to be wearing a habit.

It was so much fun to try and take pictures that match the scene where Shelagh is waiting to catch a bus 🚌. It was tricky taking pictures because her hair kept falling off and her jacket wouldn't stay closed, but Mitch remains my faithful photo editor.
