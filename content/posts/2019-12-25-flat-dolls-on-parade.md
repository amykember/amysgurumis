Just a quick hello before the end of 2019 with resolutions for more content in 2020. On December 7th I was in a craft show for the first time in years. My stall was a bit sparse; I always think I'll have more time to prep than I really do.

Disney+ was a great entertainer while I toiled away over my crochet hook and Bernat Handicrafter Cotton. I displayed flat dolls a-plenty but my bird ornaments turned out to be the better seller. No one seemed crazed about my subtle nod to Harry Potter with a flat doll for each Hogwarts house. Live and learn, I suppose. My little cousin Pat was a great help—there with my Aunt Julia who sells button art—he is a great supporter of artisans.

And speaking of buttons, I received one of her pieces for Christmas this morning: it's Belle! You can check out her Etsy shop [Buttons and Boys](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/ButtonsandBoys) to see more.

Other favourite gifts include a Little Women cookbook. I cannot wait to see the new movie!

As well as several requested reads.

All in all an excellent Christmas. Wishing everyone a magical holiday and happy new year!
