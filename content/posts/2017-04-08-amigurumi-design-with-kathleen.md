I'm back today with some amigurumiÂ inspiration. Kathleen is a talented crocheter; she made the amigurumi below by following theÂ [Little Bunny][bunny] pattern. Kathleen contacted me on Etsy andÂ made a great request for the [Little Bunny's wardrobe][wardrobe]: open backed shirts and dresses so the clothing is easier to take on and off and you don't have to stretch shirts over the bunny's head.

I wrote up a [pattern for an open backed shirt][shirt], and Kathleen cleverly adapted the instructions to several outfits that you can see below. Her designs are so creative!

I'm looking forward to trying this out with different bunny outfits myself. It's great when crocheters findÂ improvements the designer hasn't thought of. Thank you Kathleen ðŸ˜€!
