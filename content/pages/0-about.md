Hello! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Amy, and I love to crochet and design amigurumis.

It all started one summer when my cousin and I found a [collection of amigurumi patterns][book] in a used book store and I crocheted my first stuffed animal (a pig). I then spent several months following patterns by [Ana Paula Rimoli][ana] before I felt confident enough to start designing my own.

I opened my Etsy shop in 2010 and listed a mini doll pattern that's now available for free here on my blog. As I continued designing, I learned new techniques for switching colours, stuffing with poly-fill, attaching limbs, and using safety eyes. I also experimented with different fibres and yarn weights.

I got plenty of practice crocheting custom orders for friends and family. These characters ranged from Angry Birds to Harry Potter, Doctor Who, and Paw Patrol. I love designing original amigurumi animals or dolls, as well as ones inspired by my favourite books or television series. I've crocheted versions of [Chummy][], [Sister Bernadette][], [Shelagh][], and [Trixie][] from BBC's Call the Midwife, and all three were featured in the January 2017 Let's Knit Magazine.

Nowadays, I'm working on ways to simplify the pattern-writing process. Thanks for visiting Amy's Gurumis!
